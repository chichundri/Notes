#Kubernetes
Single pod can have single/multiple containers
#container - package your application and isolate from host. 
  e.g google kubernetes,docker container.
#kubernetes - 
  1.  open source ___container management_ tool which automates container deployment,container scaling and load balancing.
  2.  developed by Google in golang
  3.  can group 'n' no. of group in single unit.
  4.  manages multiple docker containers

#Features
  1.  Binpackaging.
  2.  service discovery & load balancing.
  3.  storage orchestration
  4.  self healing
  5.  batch execution
  6.  secret & configuration management
  7.  horizontal scaling
  8.  automatic rollout & rolebacks
  9.  Configuration management

Kubernetes is not
  -Docker, Docker is containerization platform and kubernetes is container management platform. Docker swarm does container management
    similar to kubernetes.
Kubernetes is 
  -container orchestration and nothing but
  -Robust and reliable.
  -best solution for scaling up containers
  -backed by huge community.

#Kubernete vs docker swarm
  1.  kubernetes installation and conf. is complicated than docker swarm
  2.  kubernete GUI available,docker swarm GUI not available.
  3.  K8S scaling up is slow but gurantees stronger cluster state,where as docker swarm is faster but cluster strenth is not robust.
  4.  K8S load balancing is manual, where is load balancing in DS is prebuit.
  5.  Data volumes cannot shared outside POD,where as it is possible in Docker swarm 

One pod can run multiple container in kubernetes.

#Working of k8s- 
kubernetes master - controls the cluster and manages the nodes in it.
Nodes - host the container inside them, containers are inside separate POD's
POD - logical collection of containers which needs to interact with each other for an application.
