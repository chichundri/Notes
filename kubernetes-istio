expose service in kubernetes -
kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort --port=8080
to access service - minikube service hello-minikube
Alternatively, use kubectl to forward the port:
kubectl port-forward service/hello-minikube 7080:8080
LoadBalancer deployments:
kubectl create deployment balanced --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4  
kubectl expose deployment balanced --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080

minikube tunnel

To find the routable IP, run this command and examine the EXTERNAL-IP column:
kubectl get services balanced
Your deployment is now available at <EXTERNAL-IP>:8080

What is Ingress?  
Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.  

* You must have an Ingress controller to satisfy an Ingress. Only creating an Ingress resource has no effect.
You may need to deploy an Ingress controller such as ingress-nginx.


minikube service web --url
